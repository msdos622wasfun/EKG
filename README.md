# EKG
 A little graphics demo that simulates the rhythm of a heartbeat on an electrocardiograph.

This program was written with AppGameKit Studio.  The way it works is that when you compile an app, you must distribute an executable stub file that is used to run the bytecode that it creates (which it stores in the media folder).  I've decided not to include that runner file, since I assume it might be part of the copyright of AGK's publisher, and that would conflict with the open source license.

Also, please note that the program requires DirectX 9 and/or OpenGL in order to work.  If you encounter any errors with DirectX, visit the following webpage in order to download the correct version of the End-User Runtimes:
